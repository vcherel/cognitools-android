I started the creation of an Android App, to group multiple functionnalities. I want it to be minimalistic and fast.

I am now creating a flashcard component, where the final goal is to learn word and associated definitions.
Here is the functionnality I would like :
- Create list (DONE)
- Edit / Delete list (DONE)
- Add elements in list (...)
- Edit elements from list (...)
- Clever training (TODO)
- Import export data to internal files (TODO)


I have this code in my MainActivity :
XXX

Give me a simple code to open a list, and add elements inside of it.
When I open a list, I want it to open a brand new screen, which looks exactly like the list screen, but with elements instead of lists.
Put comments so that I know what is going on with the variables
