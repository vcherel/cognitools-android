- **Undercover Game**

Play a social deduction game where each player receives a secret word. Most players get the same word, but one or multiple ***Undercover*** have a different word and/or one or multiple ***Mr. White*** don’t get any word at all. Players take turns giving clues about their word, trying not to reveal it. The goal is to identify the undercovers while undercovers try to blend in.

The pairs of words used in the game were generated automatically using **NLP** and **FastText embeddings**. Using this method, the game includes more than 280,000 pairs of related words.
